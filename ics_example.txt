# This is an example of a file of initial conditions.

# Each data row below corresponds to one particles and has seven entries: a mass, 3 position components and 3 velocity components.
# Masses can be positive, zero (for test particles) or negative. In the latter case, the particles are interpreted as
# background particles that have positive mass |m|, but are not accelerated by any other particle or an external potential. Hence,
# such background particles just move uniformly on a straight line specified by their initial position and velocity. If they have
# zero velocity they just add a static background potential.

# The particular example below generates two bodies of equal mass, which are in circular orbit around each other if G is set to 1
# in the parameter file. In this case, a full orbit is completed in a simulation time of 4*pi=12.56637.

# As illustrated in this example file, empty lines and lines starting with '#' are ignored.
