# Snapshot format
# There are three different file formats:
# 1 : ascii files snapshot_000000.txt, snapshot_000001.txt, ...
# 2 : binary files snapshot_000000.bin, snapshot_000001.bin, ...
# 3 : single binary stream snapshot_all.bin containing all snapshots

# Output floating point precision
# This parameter specifies the number of bytes used per floating-point variable in the output snapshot files.
# It has no bearing on the internal computation accuracy, which is always performed at 8-byte double precision.
# The default value is 8 (double precision), but 4 may sometimes be preferable to reduce the file size.

# Output content
# If include_bg is set to 'yes' (or 'y', 't', 1), all particles are stored in each snapshot;
# if it is set to 'no' (or 'n', 'f', 0), only foreground particles, i.e. those with non-negative masses in the IC file, are stored.

# Timing
# Units of time are set by the units of positions an velocities in the ICs file, namely
# [unit of time in seconds] = [unit of length in meters] / [unit of velocity in m/s]
# e.g. for length units of 1AU=1.49598e11m and velocity units of 1km/s=1e3m/s, one unit of time is 1.49598e8s≈4.74yrs

# Gravitational constant
# Units of G are set by the units of the ICs file, namely
# [unit of G in m^3*kg^(-1)*s^(-2)] = [unit of length in meters] * [unit of velocity in m/s]^2 / [unit of mass in kg]
# e.g. for lengths units of 1AU=1.49598e11m, velocity units of 1km/s=1e3m/s and mass units of 1Msun=1.98847e30kg, a unit of G is
# 7.523272e-14 m^3*kg^(-1)*s^(-2). In these units the true value of G is about 887.154.

# Integration algorithm
# 'euler' = Euler algorithm (1st order non-symplectic, only used for demonstration)
# 'leapfrog' = symplectic Leapfrog algorithm (2nd order symplectic)
# 'rk4' = Runge-Kutta algorithm (4th order non-symplectic)
# 'yoshida' or 'yoshida4' = symplectic Yoshida1990 algorithm (4th order symplectic)
# 'yoshida6' = symplectic Yoshida1990 algorithm (6th order symplectic)

# Boundary conditions
# If the box_size is 0, open boundary conditions are adopted. If box_size>0, the simulation is run in a cubic
# box of side length box_size with periodic boundary conditions. In this case, the cubic box is contained in the interval
# [0,box_size) in all three Cartesian coordinates, and all initial positions must be contained in this interval.
# For periodic boundary conditions, the force between any two particles is always calculated along their shortest separation,
# which may cross 0-3 boundaries.

# External acceleration field
# If acceleration is set to 'yes' (or 'y', 't', 1), all particles other than background particles are subjected to an
# external acceleration field that can generally depend on position and time. This field is specified in the module
# module_acceleration.f90. Changing this module requires recompiling. The external acceleration field can
# depend on up to five parameters that can be specified in this parameter file (p1, p2, p3, p4, p5). If not specified,
# these parameters are assumed to be 0.
