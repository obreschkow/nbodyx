# Timing
# Units of time are set by the units of positions an velocities in the ICs file, namely
# [unit of time in seconds] = [unit of length in meters] / [unit of velocity in m/s]
# e.g. for length units of of 1AU=1.49598e11m and velocity units of 1km/s=1e3m/s, one unit of time is 1.49598e8sâ‰ˆ4.74yrs

# Gravitational constant
# Units of G are set by the units of the ICs file, namely
# [unit of G in m^3*kg^(-1)*s^(-2)] = [unit of length in meters] * [unit of velocity in m/s]^2 / [unit of mass in kg]
# e.g. for lengths units of 1AU=1.49598e11m, velocity units of 1km/s=1e3m/s and mass units of 1Msun=1.98847e30kg, a unit of G is
# 7.523272e-14 m^3*kg^(-1)*s^(-2). In these units the true value of G=6.67430e-11 m^3*kg^(-1)*s^(-2) has the value 887.154

# Integration algorithm
# 'euler' = Euler algorithm (1st order => error of order dt^2)
# 'leapfrog' = symplectic Leapfrog algorithm (2nd order => error of order dt^3)
# 'yoshida' or 'yoshida4' = symplectic Yoshida1990 algorithm (4th order => error of order dt^5)
